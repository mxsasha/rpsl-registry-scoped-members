            Registry scoped membership for RPSL set objects
              draft-romijn-rpsl-registry-scoped-members-00

Abstract

   This document specifies src-members, a new attribute on as-set and
   route-set objects in the Routing Policy Specification Language
   (RPSL).  This attribute allows references between sets to include a
   specific registry name, avoiding problematic ambiguity while
   resolving.  A new validation rule allows gradual upgrades and
   backwards compatibility.

1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] defines
   the as-set and route-set objects, extended in [RFC4012].  These are
   among the most common objects in Internet Routing Registry (IRR)
   registries.  These sets often reference other sets as well through
   their members and mp-members attributes [RFC4012].  Server and client
   software can follow these references to resolve a set down to its
   members, a set of prefixes or ASes.

   However:

   1.  There are multiple large IRR registries (and often, many are
       loaded in one IRR server).

   2.  Sets often reference sets in other registries.

   3.  There is no uniqueness in set names amongst the different
       registries.

   4.  Hence, multiple objects may exist in the same server with the
       same name, making references to them ambiguous.

   There is no current way to prevent such ambiguity, both for operators
   who create the legitimate objects and those who try to resolve them.

   While not defined in the standard, most IRRs allow scoping a set name
   to an ASN by using single colons, e.g.  AS65000:AS-EXAMPLE, possibly
   with authorization required through aut-num AS65000.  However, this
   authorization only works within a single IRR registry.  It only helps
   for some accidental conflicts.

   To solve this, this documents adds src-members to as-set and route-
   set objects, using a IRR registry name prefix with a double colon.
   For example, "RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE", a format already used by operators
   informally.  Continued availability of existing (mp-)members
   attributes together with new validation rules, ensures backwards
   compatibility.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The src-members attribute

2.1.  as-set class

   The new src-members attribute on as-set is similar to the members
   attribute from [RFC2622], except that the AS set name MUST be
   prefixed with a registry name.

   Attribute:
      src-members

   Value:
      list of ([as-number] or [registry-name]::[as-set-name])

   Type:
      optional, multi-valued

2.2.  route-set class

   The new src-members attribute on as-set is similar to the mp-members
   attribute from [RFC4012], except that any references to set names
   MUST be prefixed with a registry name.

   Attribute:

Internet-Draft  Registry scoped members for RPSL set obj   November 2024


      src-members

   Value:
      list of ([ipv4-address-prefix-range] or [ipv6-address-prefix-
      range] or [registry-name]::[route-set-name] or [registry-
      name]::[as-set-name] or [as-number] or [registry-name]::[route-
      set-name][range-operator])

   Type:
      optional, multi-valued

2.3.  Resolving members through src-members

   When IRR software is resolving the members of a set which has a src-
   members attribute, the resolver MUST NOT consider the contents of the
   members or mp-members attribute.

   To find the referred set, the resolver MUST match on both the IRR
   registry name and the set's primary key.  If the IRR registry is
   unknown to the resolver, no set can match the reference.

   When an as-set/route-set does not contain an src-members attribute,
   the resolver SHOULD consider the values of members and mp-members.
   If references are found to a set, and there are multiple sets with
   this primary key known to the resolver, the behavior is not defined
   by this document.

3.  Relation to (mp-)members

   Existing IRR software will not be aware of the new src-members
   attribute and instead refer to (mp-)members.  Existing IRR objects
   may not be updated with src-members for some time, as this can not be
   done automatically.  Deployment in both software and objects will be
   a gradual process, however, even partial deployment will reduce the
   potential for issues from reference mixups.

   In order to keep support for existing IRR software, the contents of
   src-members must match (mp-)members as close as possible, which the
   IRR server can ensure.

3.1.  Additional validation

   When an authoritative IRR registry processes a set object with a src-
   members attribute, it MUST ensure that the union of values in members
   and mp-members is equal to the values of src-members with the
   registry names removed from set references.  All values MUST be
   combined, regardless if they were listed in one attribute, or in
   multiple repetitions of the attribute.

   This ensures that the new src-members can be used, providing the
   benefits for updated software, while still having a consistent
   (mp-)members available for older software.

   IRR registry software is RECOMMENDED to make the src-members
   attribute mandatory on all new as-set/route-set objects, and MAY make
   it required when modifying existing objects.

   Example of a valid object:

   route-set: RS-EXAMPLE
   members: 192.0.2.0/24
   mp-members: 2001:db8::/32
   mp-members: RS-OTHER
   src-members: 192.0.2.0/24, RIPE::RS-OTHER, 2001:db8::/32
   source: EXAMPLE

                           Figure 1: Valid object

   Example of an invalid object:

   route-set: RS-EXAMPLE
   members: 192.0.2.0/24
   mp-members: 2001:db8::/36
   mp-members: RS-OTHER, RS-MPMBRONLY
   src-members: 192.0.2.0/24, RIPE::RS-OTHER
   src-members: NTTCOM::RS-SRCMBRONLY, 2001:db8::/32
   source: EXAMPLE

     Figure 2: Invalid object: inconsistent inclusion of RS-MPMBRONLY,
              NTTCOM::RS- SRCMBRONLY, and 200:db8::/36 vs /32

3.2.  Automatic generation of (mp-)members

   Managing multiple copies of the same records is tedious for users.
   Therefore, IRR registry software is RECOMMENDED to automatically fill
   (mp-)members, if not specified by the user, based on src-members.

   Specifically, for authoritative IRR registries:

   *  It is RECOMMENDED that when processing a route-set object with a
      src-members attribute, but without both a members and mp-members
      attribute, the software fills the mp-members attribute
      automatically with the contents of src-members, with IRR registry
      prefix removed from references.

Internet-Draft  Registry scoped members for RPSL set obj   November 2024


   *  It is RECOMMENDED that when processing an as-set object with a
      src-members attribute, but without a members attribute, the
      software fills the members attribute automatically with the
      contents of src-members, with IRR registry prefix removed from
      references.

   The registry MAY return an informational message to the user about
   the modifications.  The objects MUST NOT be modified if already
   submitted with any members or mp-members attribute, though the
   validation rules noted above must still be applied.

   IRR registry software MUST NOT attempt to automatically derive src-
   members from (mp-)members, as this can not be done reliably.

3.3.  Multiple references to the same primary key

   _Note for review: this option is questionable.  The risk is that the
   difference_ _in interpretation between legacy members and new src-
   members increases._

   Adding a IRR registry scope to each reference allows a new behavior:

   as-set: AS-EXAMPLE
   members: AS-OTHER
   src-members: RIPE::AS-OTHER, ARIN::AS-OTHER
   source: EXAMPLE

      Figure 3: Valid object using multiple registry prefixes with the
                           same RPSL primary key

   Assuming both RIPE and ARIN have an as-set with primary key AS-OTHER,
   the [RFC2622] interpretation of this members attribute is ambiguous
   in which object is referenced.  It is however clear that it refers to
   one of them.

   The new option of src-members not only allows defining which single
   object was meant to be referenced, but also allows operators to
   intentionally include multiple objects that have the same primary key
   in their respective IRR registries.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document removes a potential security issue where routing policy
   could be manipulated by maliciously creating set objects, which could
   be picked over legitimate objects.

   While not a new issue, references between set objects may be
   circular, and software must detect such cases while resolving.  It
   may also choose to limit depth or size of their resolving to avoid
   excessive resource use.
