              Registry scoped members for RPSL set objects
              draft-romijn-rpsl-registry-scoped-members-00

Abstract

   This document updates [RFC2622] and [RFC4012] by specifying src-
   members, a new attribute on as-set and route-set objects in the
   Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL).  This attribute allows
   a specific registry to be specified for each member in a set,
   avoiding problematic ambiguity when resolving set members.  A new
   validation rule allows gradual upgrades and backwards compatibility.

1.  Introduction

   The Routing Policy Specification Language (RPSL) [RFC2622] defines
   the as-set and route-set objects, extended in [RFC4012].  These are
   among the most common objects in the Internet Routing Registry (IRR)
   system.  These sets can either reference a direct member of the set
   (such as an AS number, IP prefix, etc.), or additional sets which
   themselves have their own direct members and/or reference yet more
   sets, ad infinitum.  In both cases, this referencing uses the members
   and mp-members attributes [RFC4012].  Server and client software can
   follow these references to resolve a set down to its members, a set
   of prefixes or ASes.

   A set may refer to another set by including the primary key in its
   (mp-)members attribute, which may be in the same, or another IRR
   registry.  It is not possible to specify the IRR registry of the
   referred set.  This makes it primary key collisions possible when
   resolving a set:

   1.  There are multiple significant IRR registries.

   2.  Sets often reference objects in registries other than the
       registry the set itself is stored in.

   3.  There is no guaranteed uniqueness of object primary keys amongst
       the different registries.

   4.  Hence, multiple objects may exist in the IRR system with the same
       name, making references to them ambiguous.

   5.  Many IRR servers will mirror data from multiple IRRs, meaning
       that even within a single server, there are usually collisions.

   The ambiguity encountered when resolving set members can result in
   either an incorrect RPSL object being chosen, because an object with
   the same primary key was retrieved from the wrong IRR registry, or
   the required RPSL object (which does exist) is not found, because the
   resolving process didn't try to retrieve the object from the correct
   IRR registry.  "Incorrect" and "wrong" in this context meaning: not
   as intended or expected by the operator.

   With the former case, the result can be that unintentional routing
   policy information maybe be computed and deployed to network
   infrastructure, which could aid in route leaking, and in the worst
   case, route hijacking.  This has been seen multiple times on the
   public Internet.

   With either case, routing policy information may end up missing and
   connectivity may be disrupted.

   There is no current way to prevent such ambiguity during set member
   resolution, both for operators who create the legitimate objects and
   those who try to resolve them.

   Two previous enhancements to reduce set name collisions have been
   standardized. however, the problem persists:

   *  [RFC2622] Section 5.1 defines hierarchical set names, such as
      AS65000:AS-EXAMPLE which may also have additional authorization
      requirements for the referred aut-num.  However, this
      authorization only works within a single IRR registry, and doesn't
      allow the correct external IRR to be specified, if the object in
      question is not local to the IRR registry storing the referring
      set.

   *  [RFC2725] Section 9.6 defines external repository (IRR)
      references.  This allows for the correct IRR registry to be
      specified for a set member object by using the SOURCE:: notation
      however, this syntax isn't supported in the members filed of set
      objects.

   To solve this, this documents adds src-members to as-set and route-
   set objects, using a IRR registry name prefix with a double colon.
   For example, "RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE", a format already used by operators
   informally, for example in PeeringDB.  Continued availability of
   existing (mp-)members attributes together with new validation rules,
   ensures backwards compatibility.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  The src-members attribute

2.1.  as-set class

   The new src-members attribute on as-set is similar to the members
   attribute from [RFC2622], except that the AS set name MUST be
   prefixed with a registry name.

   Attribute:
      src-members

   Value:
      list of ([as-number] or [registry-name]::[as-set-name])

   Type:
      optional, multi-valued

2.2.  route-set class

   The new src-members attribute on as-set is similar to the mp-members
   attribute from [RFC4012], except that any references to set names
   MUST be prefixed with a registry name.

   Attribute:
      src-members

   Value:

      list of ([ipv4-address-prefix-range] or [ipv6-address-prefix-
      range] or [registry-name]::[route-set-name] or [registry-
      name]::[as-set-name] or [as-number] or [registry-name]::[route-
      set-name][range-operator])

   Type:
      optional, multi-valued

2.3.  Resolving members through src-members

   When IRR software is resolving the members of a set which has a src-
   members attribute, the resolver MUST NOT consider the contents of the
   members or mp-members attribute.

   To find the referred set, the resolver MUST match on both the IRR
   registry name and the set's primary key.  If the IRR registry is
   unknown to the resolver, no set can match the reference.

   When an as-set/route-set does not contain an src-members attribute,
   the resolver SHOULD consider the values of members and mp-members.
   If references are found to a set, and there are multiple sets with
   this primary key known to the resolver, the behavior is not defined
   by this document.

3.  Relation to (mp-)members

   Existing IRR software will not be aware of the new src-members
   attribute and instead refer to (mp-)members.  This is also why the
   existing attributes can not be modified - this software would
   consider e.g.  RIPE::AS-EXAMPLE as the full primary key, and fail to
   look up the reference as intended.

   Existing IRR objects may also not be updated with src-members for
   some time, as this can not be done automatically.  Deployment in both
   software and objects will be a gradual process, however, even partial
   deployment will reduce the potential for issues from reference
   mixups.

   In order to keep support for existing IRR software, the contents of
   src-members must match (mp-)members as close as possible, which the
   IRR server can ensure.

3.1.  Additional validation

   When an authoritative IRR registry processes a set object with a src-
   members attribute, it MUST ensure that the union of values in members
   and mp-members is equal to the values of src-members with the
   registry names removed from set references.  All values MUST be
   combined, regardless if they were listed in one attribute, or in
   multiple repetitions of the attribute.

   This ensures that the new src-members can be used, providing the
   benefits for updated software, while still having a consistent
   (mp-)members available for older software.

   IRR registry software is RECOMMENDED to make the src-members
   attribute mandatory on all new as-set/route-set objects, and MAY make
   it required when modifying existing objects.

   Example of a valid object:

   route-set: RS-EXAMPLE
   members: 192.0.2.0/24
   mp-members: 2001:db8::/32
   mp-members: RS-OTHER
   src-members: 192.0.2.0/24, RIPE::RS-OTHER, 2001:db8::/32
   source: EXAMPLE

                           Figure 1: Valid object

   Example of an invalid object:

   route-set: RS-EXAMPLE
   members: 192.0.2.0/24
   mp-members: 2001:db8::/36
   mp-members: RS-OTHER, RS-MPMBRONLY
   src-members: 192.0.2.0/24, RIPE::RS-OTHER
   src-members: NTTCOM::RS-SRCMBRONLY, 2001:db8::/32
   source: EXAMPLE

     Figure 2: Invalid object: inconsistent inclusion of RS-MPMBRONLY,
              NTTCOM::RS- SRCMBRONLY, and 200:db8::/36 vs /32

3.2.  Automatic generation of (mp-)members

   Managing multiple copies of the same records is tedious for users.
   Therefore, IRR registry software is RECOMMENDED to automatically fill
   (mp-)members, if not specified by the user, based on src-members.

   Specifically, for authoritative IRR registries:



Romijn                    Expires 19 July 2025                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft  Registry scoped members for RPSL set obj    January 2025


   *  It is RECOMMENDED that when processing a route-set object with a
      src-members attribute, but without both a members and mp-members
      attribute, the software fills the mp-members attribute
      automatically with the contents of src-members, with IRR registry
      prefix removed from references.

   *  It is RECOMMENDED that when processing an as-set object with a
      src-members attribute, but without a members attribute, the
      software fills the members attribute automatically with the
      contents of src-members, with IRR registry prefix removed from
      references.

   The registry MAY return an informational message to the user about
   the modifications.  The objects MUST NOT be modified if already
   submitted with any members or mp-members attribute, though the
   validation rules noted above must still be applied.

   IRR registry software MUST NOT attempt to automatically derive src-
   members from (mp-)members, as this can not be done reliably.

3.3.  Multiple references to the same primary key

   _Note for review: this option is questionable.  The risk is that the
   difference_ _in interpretation between legacy members and new src-
   members increases._

   Adding a IRR registry scope to each reference allows a new behavior:

   as-set: AS-EXAMPLE
   members: AS-OTHER
   src-members: RIPE::AS-OTHER, ARIN::AS-OTHER
   source: EXAMPLE

      Figure 3: Valid object using multiple registry prefixes with the
                           same RPSL primary key

   Assuming both RIPE and ARIN have an as-set with primary key AS-OTHER,
   the [RFC2622] interpretation of this members attribute is ambiguous
   in which object is referenced.  It is however clear that it refers to
   one of them.

   The new option of src-members not only allows defining which single
   object was meant to be referenced, but also allows operators to
   intentionally include multiple objects that have the same primary key
   in their respective IRR registries.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document removes a potential security issue where routing policy
   could be manipulated by maliciously creating set objects, which could
   be picked over legitimate objects.

   While not a new issue, references between set objects may be
   circular, and software must detect such cases while resolving.  It
   may also choose to limit depth or size of their resolving to avoid
   excessive resource use.
